# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE SECURITY ACTIONS REQUIRED

Your Stripe API key is compromised and accessible on the internet. Follow these steps **immediately**:

## Step 1: Generate New Stripe API Key (DO THIS FIRST!)

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. **Delete the compromised key** (`sk_live_...nL4r`)
3. **Create a new secret key**
4. Copy the new key (starts with `sk_live_` or `sk_test_`)

## Step 2: Update GitHub Repository Secrets

Go to your GitHub repository â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions

**Add/Update these secrets:**

```
DOCKER_USERNAME = your_dockerhub_username
DOCKER_PASSWORD = your_dockerhub_password
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = pk_live_your_publishable_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL = https://yourdomain.com
DEPLOY_HOST = ec2-35-153-55-84.compute-1.amazonaws.com
EC2_SSH_KEY = [paste entire content of checkout.pem file]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = [your NEW secret key from Step 1]
```

## Step 3: Trigger Secure Deployment

1. **Commit and push the security fixes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Security fix: Remove secret key from Docker image"
git push origin master
```

2. **Monitor the deployment:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository â†’ Actions tab
   - Watch both "build" and "deploy" jobs complete successfully

## Step 4: Verify Security Fix

1. **Check your EC2 instance:**
```bash
ssh -i "checkout.pem" ubuntu@ec2-35-153-55-84.compute-1.amazonaws.com
docker ps  # Should show new container running
docker logs stripe-checkout  # Should show no errors
```

2. **Test your application:**
   - Visit your application URL
   - Try making a test payment
   - Check Stripe dashboard for new API calls with the new key

## What Was Fixed

âœ… **Secret key removed from Docker image** - No longer embedded in build
âœ… **Secure runtime deployment** - Secret key only exists on your server at runtime  
âœ… **Updated CI/CD pipeline** - Automatically deploys securely
âœ… **Environment file protection** - Secret stored in secure file with proper permissions

## Why This Happened

- Your old setup embedded the secret key directly into the Docker image during build
- Anyone with access to the Docker image could extract the API key
- The image was likely pushed to Docker Hub, making it publicly accessible

## Security Benefits Now

- Secret keys are never in Docker images
- Keys are only stored in GitHub's secure secrets and your server's secure environment file
- Automatic secure deployment without manual intervention
- Old compromised images are automatically cleaned up

## Next Steps After Fix

1. **Monitor Stripe dashboard** for any unauthorized activity
2. **Set up monitoring alerts** in Stripe for unusual activity
3. **Review your server access logs** for any suspicious activity
4. **Consider enabling 2FA** on your Stripe account
